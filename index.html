        You are local police officers of a suburb of a City named Waterdeep.
        Late one evening you receive a call from a local who says that there was
        a large meteor that went by overhead, and the lights on the block go
        out. You and a couple of buddies go to investigate.
      </p>
      <p>
        The call originated in the boonies where a couple of cul de sacks are
        located, each with 6 or seven houses in them. You are going simply to
        see what happened and who to send to fix the power issue.
      </p>

        The drive out there takes 30 minutes. Most of the residents of the
        neighborhoods have been there for a many years, Though they generally
        like to keep to themselves.
